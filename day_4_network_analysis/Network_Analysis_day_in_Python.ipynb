    "In this session, you will get an introduction to how to represent a network with the help of Python (or R, see other script), how to calculate basic network descriptives (on the micro, meso and macro level), and how to put on the \"network thinking hat\". You are invited to work through the exercise sheet on your own with help of mine and Carl where needed. If you are already familiar with some aspects of the lab, feel free to jump over certain sections.\n",

    "Community detection is a very large field of research and has received a lot of attention in the past. The wish behind community detection basically is to identify a network's mesoscale organisation. In simplistic terms, a community is a group of nodes which are somewhat more related to each other than to others in the network. Community detection for networks is conceptually similar to data clustering in machine learning. It is helpful if one wants to find nodes that would, for example, react similarly to an external stimulus or if you want to visualise the meso-level organisation of a network. \n",

    "_NetworkX_ has some community detection algorithms built-in, which you can find [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/community.html), and which we will use in the following. If you get interested, there is another Python library called [`cdlib`](https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/algorithms.html), which has even more algorithms implemented."

The idea behind this measure is a comparison of the number of ties that occur in-group vs such that bridge to another group compared to the total number of ties. The assortativity coefficient, however, is a bit more advanced than this simple illustration: It is able to take different group sizes/more than two groups into account. For the assortativity coefficient, 1 means perfect assortativity (assortativity: more in-group than between group ties), -1 means perfect disassortativity (disassortativity: more between group than in-group ties)."

Another stunning case, driven by homophily, that I want to bring to your attention is that even mild preferences often result in very strict homophilic patterns (along the lines of \"the aggregate is more than the sum (of individual-level preferences)\"). One of the most famous examples to illustrate this segregation (see work of Nobel Prize-winning game theorist Thomas Schelling, and especially his paper [Dynamic models of segregation](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf) from 1971). You can play an interactive version of the paper content here: [Parable of Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/). Even if people are happy being in the minority, the group ends up being segregated. Comment: There is no network in this interactive post, but one could easily transfer this to a friendship network where people are allowed to rewire their connections."

    "It's time for the next peculiarity of network effects: The friendship paradox. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the data from the following [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1592665.1592675): \n",
    "Viswanath, B., Mislove, A., Cha, M., & Gummadi, K. P. (2009). On the evolution of user interaction in Facebook. Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Online Social Networks, 37–42. \n",

    "(1) Read in the data, and construct your graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) We are interested in the assortativity by number of friends (i.e. the degree assortativity). Generate a plot that shows the average number of the friends of a person's friends against the number of this person's friends. Add the identity line (line that goes through (0,0) and (1,1)). \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Persons above the identity line have fewer friends than their average neighbour, while nodes below the identity line have more. The friendship paradox states that most nodes have fewer friends than their friends on average. Can you check whether the friendship paradox is also at play in the Facebook network? (Hint: One needs to count the number of nodes above and below the identity line and compare the size of both groups.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Calculate the degree assortativity. You can use `nx.degree_assortativity_coefficient(G_facebook)`. \n"
